# MNIST-Classification-and-Analysis
This project focuses on exploring and classifying the MNIST dataset using Python and key libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Keras.

MNIST Classification and Analysis
This project demonstrates a binary classification approach using the MNIST dataset. The code filters and classifies digits 0 and 8 based on their center pixel averages. It includes data visualization, feature engineering, and a simple threshold-based classifier.

Features
Data Visualization: Displays example MNIST images and their labels.
Binary Classification: Focuses on distinguishing between digits 0 and 8.
Feature Engineering: Computes the center pixel average of images as a distinguishing feature.
Threshold-Based Classification: Implements a straightforward method for classifying digits based on the computed feature.
